# malloclab

This repository contains a solution for malloclab persuant to a course at the IT University of Copenhagen in 2019.

Please don't plagiarize it.
But do feel free to get inspired and all that.

Also if you want to use it for actual memory allocation in you application: DON'T.
Just use libc. It's heaps better ;)
